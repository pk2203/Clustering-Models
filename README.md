## Clustering Models 
Objective : In this challenge, you are given a dataset where each row belongs to a particular cluster. The datset describes the (simulated) manufacturing control data that can be clustered into different control states.
Your job is to predict the cluster each row belongs to. You are not given any training data, and you are not told how many clusters are found in the ground truth labels.
Models used :
1. KMeans 
2. GMM 
3. BGM 
4. LightGBM 
Ensembling multiple models, algorithm tried to recurisviely learn using Adjusted Random Index
